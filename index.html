        <h2>Projects and Studying</h2>
        <p>With my dad, I've developed amazing tools and technologies, including the Grok API Key and DeepSeek running locally, and I have also used ChatGPT to make other interesting inventions.</p>

        <p>I have also been learning about the history of computers, the console market, and phone software. Also, I would like to tell you that I have completed Grade 8 Piano with a merit (123) and am doing Grade 6 Violin on March 31, 2025.</p>
